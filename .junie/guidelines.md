## Code Guidelines

1. Generate strict typescript. Do not use implicit `any` types. Avoid explicit `any` types unless absolutely necessary.
2. You MUST run `npm run build` after any changes .ts and .tsx files to validate and fix compilation issues if any.
3. SKIP any comments, no content in `//` or `/* */` should be generated.
