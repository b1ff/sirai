# Cheaper or local Model Pre-Planning for Planning Phase

## Overview
Implement a pre-planning phase using a local or cheaper model to reduce costs by doing initial task analysis and planning before using more expensive models for the main planning phase.

## Goals
- Reduce API costs by using local models for initial planning analysis
- Maintain or improve planning quality
- Minimize latency impact
- Support existing planning phase architecture

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Planning Phase Analysis
- [ ] Analyze current planning phase structure
- [ ] Identify areas where local model can be most effective
- [ ] Determine optimal pre-planning scope
- [ ] Map out integration points with existing planning system

### 2. Pre-planner Model Integration
- [ ] Create `PrePlanner` class
  - Implement interface compatible with existing planning system
  - Support configurable model selection (e.g., Ollama, local HuggingFace models)
  - Add configuration options in `config.ts`
- [ ] Implement pre-planning prompt templates
- [ ] Add result validation and quality checks

### 3. Planning Pipeline Enhancement
- [ ] Modify planning phase to support:
  1. Local model pre-planning analysis
  2. Main model planning refinement
- [ ] Add planning result merging logic, pre-planning must go as an input to planning
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for pre-planning results

### 4. Configuration and Monitoring
- [ ] Add pre-planning model configuration options:
  - Model selection
