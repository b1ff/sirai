# Task Execution Implementation Details Enhancement

When a task executes, the LLM should be instructed to include in its response important implementation details that could be needed for subsequent sub-tasks implementation within this task. This information should be collected, structured, and included in the context for further tasks.

## Required Changes

1. Update Task Schema
   - Add `ImplementationDetails` interface to store structured information about task implementation
   - Include fields for modified files, public interfaces, and additional context
   - Add this to both `TaskPlan` and `Subtask` interfaces

2. Enhance Task Execution Prompt
   - Require LLM to provide implementation details in a specific format
   - Include sections for modified files, public interfaces, and additional context
   - Make it clear that these details will be used by dependent tasks

3. Implementation Details Format
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Details

   ### Modified/Created Files
   - `/path/to/file1` - Brief description of changes
   - `/path/to/file2` - Brief description of changes

   ### Public Interfaces
   ```typescript
   // Document any new or modified public interfaces
   // Include method signatures and types
   ```

   ### Additional Context
   - Important implementation details
   - Dependencies or configurations added
   - Patterns or approaches used
   - Information needed for future tasks
   ```

4. Dependency Context Integration
   - When executing a task, include implementation details from all dependency tasks
   - Format dependency details in a clear, structured way
   - Ensure the LLM understands and uses this context for implementation

5. Task History Integration
   - Store implementation details in task history
   - Make details available for future task planning and execution
   - Include details in task summaries and validation

## Files to Modify
- `src/task-planning/schemas.ts` - Add new interfaces and update existing ones
- `src/commands/interactive/task-executor.ts` - Update prompt and execution logic
- `src/utils/task-history-manager.ts` - Enhance history storage with implementation details

## Expected Outcome
- Each task execution will produce structured implementation details
- Dependent tasks will have access to implementation details from their prerequisites
- Task history will maintain a complete record of implementation details
- Better context sharing between related tasks
- More reliable task dependencies handling

## Validation
- Verify that implementation details are properly captured and stored
- Check that dependent tasks receive and use implementation details
- Ensure the format is consistent and useful for future tasks
- Test with complex task chains to verify context propagation
